<p>The Global Innovation Index (GII) 2020:
Who Will Finance Innovation?
In 2020, the Global Innovation Index (GII) presents its 13th edition dedicated to the theme Who Will Finance Innovation? This edition sheds light on the state of innovation financing by investigating the evolution of financing mechanisms for entrepreneurs and other innovators, and by pointing to progress and remaining challenges—including in the context of the economic slowdown induced by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis.

The virtual launch held on September 2, 2020 was graced by special messages from Mr. Francis Gurry, Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO); Mr. Wang Zhigang, Minister for Science and Technology, China; Ms. Agnès Pannier-Runacher, Minister in Charge of Industry, France; Ms. Christine Lambrecht, Minister for Justice and Consumer Protection, Germany; and Mr. Piyush Goyal, Minister of Commerce and Industry and Railways, India; and Ms. Paula Ingabire, Minister of ICT and Innovation, Rwanda.</p>
